//Eric Wilson, April 15, 2015 Dog Years//

//Dogs age 7 times faster than Humans, so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in 'dogYears'//

//Sparky is 10 years old in Human years//
//Sparky's age in dog years is 10 * 7//
//Sparky's age is 10 human years which is (7 * 10) in dog years//

var a = 10;//Sparky's age in Human years//
var dogYears = (a * 7);//Sparky's age in Human years,2, is multiplied by 7 to get his age in dog years//

var solution = "Sparky is " + a + " human years old, which is " + dogYears + " in dog years"
console.log(solution);//This is to print into the console how old Sparky is in dog years//
